    <h2 class="fade-in-delay">Dear Jessica Stirling,</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I wanted to take a moment to share my feelings with you.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Iâ€™ve been thinking about us a lot lately. Not talking to you as much has given me time to reflect â€” and even more time to miss you.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Why does it feel so bad to not be talking as much? What is missing from my life without you?
      Why do I value you so much? In the past 1.5 years, I learned what it truly feels like to fall in love with someone. 
      You provide me with an unmatched sense of companionship and partnership. 
      Your presence is so uplifting and it makes everything fun. 
      Your caring nature and motherly tendencies comfort me and make me feel so safe being vulnerable with my emotions. 
      You keep me at peace. 
      You make me feel like the strong man that I want to be, and you reassure me in the moments when I donâ€™t.
      Your affection warms me. 
      You are my best friend.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Long distance is not easy, and we should be proud to have made it this far. 
      It's hard to sync schedules, make time, and balance two lives in different cities. 
      It makes fun things less fun and the not-so-good things feel even worse. 
      Recently, I've been learning more about attachment styles and how people need different things in a relationship.
      Itâ€™s helped me understand our dynamic and realize how not always giving you the space you needed might have left you feeling trapped or overwhelmed, affecting our relationship.
      I never wanted to make you feel that way, and Iâ€™m sorry for the arguments and moments when I didn't fully recognize that before,
      but I truly believe that we can work through anything.
      Life can be tough, and relationships arenâ€™t easy, but our compatibility, love, and partnership make every effort worthwhile. 
      Having a connection this special at such a young age is incredibly valuable and meaningful to me, and it gives us plenty of time to continue growing together. 
      I can genuinely see a future with you. 
      This break hasnâ€™t been fun, but itâ€™s been a learning experience that hopefully we can take forward and grow stronger from.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I've planned some fun things for us next weekend because I know school and work have been draining,
       and I want to make sure we have a fun and relaxing weekend. I'm looking forward to spending time with you. 
      I know we'll also have some important things to talk about, and all I ask is that we come into it with an honest, open mindset and the love we've shared in our hearts. 
      No matter what, I'll appreciate the time we'll have together.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      You are so unbelievably capable, intelligent, and witty â€” you glow. 
      Watching your love and care for the people close to you reminds me how much warmth you bring into every life you touch.  
      From your stunning blue eyes to your soft brown curls to your perfect smile, laugh, and soul, you are the most beautiful girl in the world. 
      I love you unconditionally. 
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
    There should never be a Valentineâ€™s Day where you donâ€™t get flowers.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Love,
      <br>Maurice
    </p>
