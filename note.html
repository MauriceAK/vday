    <h2 class="fade-in-delay">Dear Jessica,</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I wanted to take a moment to share my feelings with you.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I’m sorry our relationship has been rocky recently.
      Not talking to you as frequently has left me with lots of time to think and even more time to miss you.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Why does it feel so bad to not be talking? What is absent from my life without you? Why do I value you so much? In the past 1.5 years I learned what it feels like to truly fall in love with someone. You provide me with an unmatched sense of companionship and partnership. Your presence is so uplifting and it makes everything fun. Your motherly tendencies comfort me and make me feel so safe being vulnerable with my emotions. You keep me at peace. You make me feel like the strong man that I want to be. Your affection warms me.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Long distance is not easy and we should be proud to have made it this far. It's hard to sync schedules, it's not easy to make time, and we lead 2 lives in 2 separate cities. It makes fun things less fun and bad things feel even worse. I’m genuinely sorry for the period of arguing that led us to this spot, but I believe that when we work together it’ll just be a bump in the road. Life can be tough, and relationships aren’t always easy, but our compatibility, love, and partnership make every effort worthwhile. Having something this special at such a young age is incredibly valuable and meaningful to me, and it gives us plenty of time to continue growing together. I can so clearly see a future and life with you. This “break” hasn’t been fun but I think it’s been a learning experience that hopefully we can take forward and grow from.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      You are so unbelievably capable, intelligent, and witty; you glow. Watching your love and care for the people close to you reminds me how much warmth you bring into every life you touch.  From your stunning blue eyes to your soft brown curls to your perfect smile, laugh, and soul, you are the most beautiful girl in the world. There should never be a Valentine’s Day where you don’t get flowers.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I love you,
      <br>Maurice
    </p>
