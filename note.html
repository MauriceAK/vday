    <h2 class="fade-in-delay">Dear Jessica Stirling,</h2>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I wanted to take a moment to share my feelings with you.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Lately, not talking to you as much has given me time to reflect â€” and even more time to miss you.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Why does it feel so empty without our daily chats?
      Why do I value you so deeply? Over the past 1.5 years, I learned what it truly feels like to fall in love. 
      You provide me with unmatched companionship and partnership. 
      Your uplifting presence makes every day brighter.
      Your caring nature comforts me, making me feel safe to be vulnerable with my emotions. 
      You help me feel like the strong man that I aspire to be, and you reassure me in the moments when I donâ€™t.
      You keep me at peace. 
      Your affection warms me. 
      You are my best friend.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Long distance is not easy, but I'm proud of how far we've come. 
      Balancing our lives in different cities is hard â€”
      it makes the fun things less fun and the tough times even harder. 
      Recently, I've learned more about attachment styles and how we all need different things in a relationship.
      This has helped me better understand our dynamic and realize how not always giving you the space you needed might have left you feeling trapped or overwhelmed and affected our relationship.
      I never wanted you to feel that way, and truly Iâ€™m sorry for the moments when I didn't fully recognize that before. 
    </p>  
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Life can be tough, and relationships arenâ€™t easy, but our compatibility, love, and partnership make every effort worthwhile. 
      Having a connection this special at such a young age is incredibly valuable and meaningful to me, and it gives us plenty of time to continue growing together. 
      I am hopeful about our future, and even during difficult times, 
      I know we can learn from them and grow stronger together.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I've planned some fun things for us next weekend because I know school and work have been draining and exhausting,
       and I want to make sure you have a fun and relaxing weekend. I'm looking forward to spending time with you. 
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Jessie, you are so unbelievably capable, intelligent, and witty â€” you glow. 
      Watching your love and care for the people close to you reminds me how much warmth you bring into every life you touch.  
      From your stunning blue eyes to your soft brown curls to your perfect smile, laugh, and soul, you are the most beautiful girl in the world. 
      I love you unconditionally. 
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
    There should never be a Valentineâ€™s Day where you donâ€™t get flowers.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      Love,
      <br>Maurice
    </p>
